## Overview

Control a multi-servo bionic arm with potentiometers. Each potentiometer maps to a servo angle, allowing intuitive movement of fingers and joints.

## Code Explained

- Reads analog values from five potentiometers.
- Maps 0–1023 readings to 0–180° servo angles.
- Writes PWM to five servo channels for smooth motion.

## How To Use

- Connect five potentiometers to `A0..A4` and power.
- Connect servos to PWM pins `3,5,6,9,10` and an external supply.
- Ensure common ground between Arduino and servo supply.
